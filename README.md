# Project-SightX
AI-powered diabetic retinopathy detection system using transfer learning (ResNet50) to enable early screening and prevent blindness. Built with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and PyTorch. A personal mission to combine my passion for biology and technology while honoring my family's journey with diabetes.
